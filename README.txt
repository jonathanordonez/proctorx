This project mimics the functionality from ProctorU.com, a site for scheduling online exams with proctors.

The webiste uses "Vanilla" JS and Django:
> See proctorx/static/js/script.js for all JS code
> See the proj1_proctorx folder for the Django project files.
> See the proctorx folder for the Django app files. 

In this demo you are presented with a login screen. Sign in with username: jonathan.oliver25@gmail.com, password: proctorx. 
Once signed in, you can take the following actions:
> Check a proctor's availability for your desired exam
> Reserve an exam session
> Check your cart
> Pay for your exam session
> Change your account settings
> Change your password
> Logout
